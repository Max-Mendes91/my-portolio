# Portfolio

Simple static portfolio website.

## About
This project is a static HTML page to showcase your portfolio. It is ideal for quick deployment to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser
- Optional: a simple HTTP server for local development

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser; or
2. Serve locally with a static server, for example:
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 5500` then visit `http://localhost:5500`
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 5500` then visit `http://localhost:5500`

## Project structure
```
/                      # project root
├── index.html         # main page
└── images/            # image assets
```

## Customization
- Edit `index.html` to change content, copy, and links.
- Replace images in `images/` as needed.
- It is recommended to optimize images for the web (format and size).

## Quick deploy
- GitHub Pages: push the content to the `main` (or `docs`) branch and enable Pages in the repository settings.
- Netlify/Vercel: import the repository and deploy as a static site (no build step required).

## License
This is a personal-use project. Adapt as needed.
